# Goal: Work with tuples as immutable sequences.
# Expected outcome:
# - Prints: "first=3 last=5"
# - Prints: "len=3"

nums = (3, 4, 5)

# TODO: set first and last using indexing
first = None
last = None

# TODO: set n to the length of nums
n = None

print(f"first={first} last={last}")
print(f"len={n}")
