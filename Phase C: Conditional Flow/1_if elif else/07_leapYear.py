# Goal: Determine whether a year is a leap year.
# Rules:
# - divisible by 400 -> Leap
# - divisible by 100 -> Not Leap
# - divisible by 4 -> Leap
# - otherwise -> Not Leap
# Expected outcome for year=1900: Not Leap
# Expected outcome for year=2000: Leap

year = 1900

# TODO: Use if/elif/else (no nested required, but allowed) to print exactly:
# "Leap" or "Not Leap"
