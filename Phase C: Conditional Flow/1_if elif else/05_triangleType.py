# Goal: Determine triangle type based on side lengths.
# Rules:
# - If any side <= 0 OR triangle inequality fails -> Not a triangle
# - Else if all three sides equal -> Equilateral
# - Else if exactly two sides equal -> Isosceles
# - Else -> Scalene
# Expected outcome for a=2, b=2, c=3: Isosceles

a = 2
b = 2
c = 3

# TODO: Use if/elif/else to print exactly one of:
# "Not a triangle", "Equilateral", "Isosceles", "Scalene"
