# Goal: Perform a calculation based on an operator and handle errors.
# Rules:
# - Supported operators: "+", "-", "*", "/"
# - If operator is not supported -> print "Unsupported operator"
# - For division:
#     - if b == 0 -> print "Cannot divide by zero"
#     - else perform a / b
# - For other operations, perform normally.
# Expected outcome for a=10, op="/", b=0: Cannot divide by zero

a = 10
op = "/"
b = 0

# TODO: Use if/elif/else to print either an error message or:
# "Result: <value>"
# Note: For division, result may be a float.
