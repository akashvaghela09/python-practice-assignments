# Goal: Refactor a complex expression by adding parentheses to match a target outcome.
# You must only add parentheses; do not change numbers/operators.
# Rewrite the expression on the second assignment line.

# Expected outcome:
# When you run this file, it must print exactly:
# 1

value = 8 - 3 * 2 ** 2 // 3 + 1
# Add parentheses to make the final printed value equal to 1:
value = __
print(value)
