# Goal: Use parentheses to override default precedence.
# Fill in the missing parentheses so that result becomes 20.

# Expected outcome:
# When you run this file, it must print exactly:
# 20

result = 2 + 3 * 6
# Add parentheses on the next line by rewriting the expression:
result = __
print(result)
