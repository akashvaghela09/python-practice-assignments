# Task: Implement remove_punctuation(s) that removes ',', '.', '!' characters.
# Implement collapse_spaces(s) that turns runs of whitespace into a single space.
# Implement clean_sentence(s) that calls remove_punctuation then collapse_spaces then strips ends.
# Expected outcome: print(clean_sentence(" Hi,,  world!!  ")) outputs exactly: Hi world
