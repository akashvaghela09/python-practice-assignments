# Goal: Read integers and compute the running average until the user enters "done".
# Use break when "done" is entered.
# Print the average with exactly 2 decimal places.
# Expected outcome: For inputs 10, 20, 30, done -> print exactly: Average: 20.00

count = 0
total = 0

while True:
    s = input().strip()
    # TODO: if s == "done", break
    # TODO: otherwise parse int, add to total, increment count
    pass

# TODO: compute average (assume count > 0) and print with 2 decimals
