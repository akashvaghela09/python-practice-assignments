# Goal: Find the smallest divisor of number greater than 1.
# If number is prime, the smallest divisor should be the number itself.
# Use a while loop.
# For number = 91, expected outcome (exact line):
# Smallest divisor: 7

number = 91

d = 2

# TODO: loop until you find a divisor
while __________:
    d = __________

print("Smallest divisor:", d)
