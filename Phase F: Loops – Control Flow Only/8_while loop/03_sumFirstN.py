# Goal: Compute the sum of integers from 1 to limit (inclusive) using a while loop.
# For limit = 10, expected outcome (exact line):
# Sum is 55

limit = 10

# TODO: use a while loop to compute total
current = 1
total = 0
while __________:
    total = __________
    current = __________

print("Sum is", total)
