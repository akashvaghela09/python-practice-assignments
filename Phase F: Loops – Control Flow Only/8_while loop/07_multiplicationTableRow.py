# Goal: Print the 7-times table from 7 x 1 through 7 x 5 using a while loop.
# Expected outcome (exact lines):
# 7 x 1 = 7
# 7 x 2 = 14
# 7 x 3 = 21
# 7 x 4 = 28
# 7 x 5 = 35

base = 7
mult = 1

# TODO: while loop to print the formatted lines up to 5
while __________:
    product = __________
    print(f"{base} x {mult} = {product}")
    mult = __________
