# Print all even numbers from n down to 0 using a while loop.
# Input: integer n
# Output: even numbers descending, each on its own line.
# Expected outcome example: if n=9, output:
# 8
# 6
# 4
# 2
# 0

n = int(input().strip())

# TODO: start from the largest even <= n

# TODO: while loop that decreases by 2 and prints values down to 0
