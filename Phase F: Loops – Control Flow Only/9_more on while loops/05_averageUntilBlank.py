# Read numbers (one per line) until a blank line is entered.
# Then print the average rounded to 2 decimals.
# If no numbers were entered, print: No data
# Input: multiple lines; termination is an empty line
# Output: either "No data" or a number like 3.50
# Expected outcome example input:
# 3
# 4
# 3
# 
# Output:
# 3.33

count = 0
total = 0.0

line = input()

# TODO: while line is not blank:
# - convert to float
# - update total and count
# - read next line

# TODO: after loop, print average to 2 decimals, or No data if count==0
