# Build a simple menu-driven calculator that runs until the user chooses to quit.
# The program should repeatedly:
# 1) read a command (one of: add, sub, mul, div, quit)
# 2) if command is quit, print "Bye" and stop
# 3) otherwise read two numbers (floats) and print the result on its own line
# Division by zero should print: "Cannot divide by zero" (and then continue loop)
# Outputs must be exact strings as specified.
# Expected outcome example interaction (inputs shown as lines):
# add
# 2
# 3
# sub
# 10
# 4
# div
# 5
# 0
# quit
# Output:
# 5.0
# 6.0
# Cannot divide by zero
# Bye

# TODO: start an infinite loop with while True

# TODO: read command

# TODO: handle quit

# TODO: for other commands, read x and y as floats and compute result

# TODO: print results exactly as required
