# Goal: Count vowels in each word using nested loops.
# Expected outcome for the given sentence:
# [('I', 1), ('love', 2), ('Python', 1)]

sentence = "I love Python"

words = sentence.split()

# TODO: Use an outer loop over words and an inner loop over characters.
# Count characters that are in vowels.
# Append (word, count) tuples to results.
