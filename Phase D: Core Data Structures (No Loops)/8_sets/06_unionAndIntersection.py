# Goal: Compute union and intersection of two sets.
# Expected outcome: It prints two lines:
# union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
# intersection: {3, 4}
# (Set order may vary, but contents must match.)

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

u = ____  # TODO: union of A and B
inter = ____  # TODO: intersection of A and B

print('union:', u)
print('intersection:', inter)
