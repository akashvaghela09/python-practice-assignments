# Remove items matching a condition, in place
# Goal: Remove all numbers less than 0 from nums (modify the same list).
# Constraint: Do NOT create a new list.
# Expected output:
# nums: [3, 0, 2, 5]

nums = [3, -1, 0, -7, 2, 5, -2]

# TODO: iterate safely and delete negatives in place
# Tip: one safe approach is iterating backwards using indexes.

print('nums:', nums)
