# Delete multiple items by their indexes
# Goal: Delete items at indexes 1, 3, and 4 from the ORIGINAL list.
# Hint: If you delete in ascending order, indexes shift.
# Expected output:
# items: ['a', 'c', 'g']

items = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
indexes_to_delete = [1, 3, 4]

# TODO: delete the specified indexes correctly
# Constraint: Use del, and avoid deleting the wrong elements due to shifting.

print('items:', items)
