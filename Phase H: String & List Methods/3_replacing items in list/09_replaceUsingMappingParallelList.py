# Goal: Replace items in one list based on a mapping defined by two parallel lists.
# Replace any fruit found in old_names with the corresponding item in new_names.
# Expected outcome: printing the list shows ['banana', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'banana']

basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'apple']
old_names = ['apple']
new_names = ['banana']

# TODO:
# For each element in basket, if it exists in old_names, replace it with the matching element in new_names.
# Do this in place.

print(basket)
