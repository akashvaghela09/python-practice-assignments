# Goal: Sort a list of (name, score) tuples by score descending.
# Expected outcome: results must become [('Cara', 99), ('Ava', 88), ('Ben', 75), ('Dan', 75)].
# Note: For equal scores, preserve original order among ties (stable sort).

results = [('Ava', 88), ('Ben', 75), ('Cara', 99), ('Dan', 75)]

# TODO: sort results in-place by score descending using a key

print(results)
