# Goal: Use numeric variables to compute a total price.
# Expected output (exactly 1 line):
# total=21.40
# Notes:
# - price is 20.00
# - tax_rate is 0.07
# - total = price + price*tax_rate
# - Print with exactly 2 digits after the decimal.

price = 20.00
tax_rate = 0.07

# TODO: compute total

print("total=" + format(total, ".2f"))
