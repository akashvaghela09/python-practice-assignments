# Goal: Read user input into variables and print a formatted message.
# Expected output (exactly 1 line, for input 'Mia' and '8'):
# Mia will be 9 next year.

name = input()            # user types a name
age_text = input()        # user types an age

# TODO: convert age_text to an integer variable age
# TODO: create next_age as age + 1

print(name + " will be " + str(next_age) + " next year.")
