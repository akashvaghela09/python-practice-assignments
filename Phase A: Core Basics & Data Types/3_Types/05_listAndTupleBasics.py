# Goal: Work with list and tuple types and index access.
# Expected outcome: Running this file prints two lines exactly:
# <class 'list'>
# green

colors_list = ["red", "green", "blue"]

# TODO: Create colors_tuple as a tuple with the same three items in the same order.
colors_tuple = "green"

print(type(colors_list))
# TODO: Print the second item from colors_tuple.
print(colors_tuple
